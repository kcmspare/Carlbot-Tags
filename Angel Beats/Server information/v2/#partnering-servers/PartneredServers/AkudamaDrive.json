    "description":"Long ago, there was a war between Kanto and Kansai and the world was split apart. Kansai became a vassal state of Kantou, and as developed in its own peculiar way. However, the power of the government and the police is waning, and crime is widespread. \n\nThese criminals are called \"akudama.\" \n\nAs these akudama gather together in one place, their aesthetics will clash and an ordinary girl will be caught up in their world of crime."
