    "description":"A story about adolescence, philosophy, friendship, and baseball. Little Busters! is a visual novel (and anime adaptation) by the same publisher and writer as Angel Beats!\n\nIt follows Riki Naoe, a high schooler who wants nothing more than to stay with his childhood friends forever. When the leader of his friend group, Kyousuke, is preparing to graduate, Riki suggests that the gang get together and do something fun one last time, like the old days. Kyousuke suggests playing baseball, and so they embark on a quest to gather new friends to fill the team.\n\nSince this is a Key work, you can expect a mix of comedy, slice of life, and gut-wrenching pain!"
